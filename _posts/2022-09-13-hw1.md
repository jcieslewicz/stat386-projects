## Introduction: Why should I use Pyenv?

Anyone who has used git understands the power of version control software for collaboration and deployment. Code versions from multiple developers can be easily merged and managed, avoiding collaboration bottlenecks and (worse) deployment disruptions. 

Another related issue that arises for python developers in collaboration and deployment is python version control. Here are some common examples:
* You need to fork a project that someone else on your team originally built several months or years ago. It should be an easy task, but when you try to run their scripts, you realize that the project was built in an old version of python that your local machine won’t support.
* You need to deploy a project to the cloud, but it depends on a multitude of python packages and Pip is re-initialized every time you spin up a new container.
* You have multiple projects going on at once, and you don’t want the overhead of hundreds of python packages floating around in your system all the time.
