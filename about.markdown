I'm a data science nerd, management consultant, and avid outdoorsman. As of current date (fall 2022), I'm finishing my last year of school studying Data Science before I go to work for Boston Consulting Group (BCG) in Austin, TX. I love finding new applications for data science tools and enabling clients to implement them. This blog will be a workspace for me to share some of my personal (non-work) projects.
